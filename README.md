## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **pnpm** (preferred) or **npm**

## Getting Started

```

### 2. Install dependencies

### 3. Run the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Available Scripts

- **`pnpm dev`** - Starts the development server with hot-reload
- **`pnpm build`** - Creates an optimized production build
- **`pnpm start`** - Runs the production server (requires `pnpm build` first)
- **`pnpm lint`** - Runs the linter to check code quality

## Development Workflow
